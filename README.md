# Login-Signup-Switch
- This page will serve as the home page in an upcoming chat application if a user is not registered/logged.

## Functionality
- The sections slide within one another to reveal the login and the sign-up reactive forms with a built in validation

## Technologies used
- Angular 7
- HTML5 & CSS3 
- RxJS
- TypeScript
- Firebase(as a backend authentication solution)

## Inspiration 
- The entire idea was drawn out of Florin Pop's blogpost which can be found here:
https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/double-slider-sign-in-up-form/

Note: No code was copied or pasted. The sole inspiration consisted of visually analyzing the movements of the forms without consulting any of the code that the blog post provides.
